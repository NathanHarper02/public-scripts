= Conditions

Conditions have to be registered in order for them to show up on a figure or in the Context Menu.

This is done by using the `ConditionApi`.
At least a name and the link to the image for this condition have to be provided.

====
[source,lua]
----
local ConditionApi = require("api.ConditionApi")

ConditionApi.registerCondition("My Condition", {
  -- the link to the image for this condition
  image = "http://..."
})
----
====

If the condition is stackable, the attribute `max` can be used as well.

====
[source,lua]
----
local ConditionApi = require("api.ConditionApi")

ConditionApi.registerCondition("My Condition", {
  image = "http://...",
  -- The condition can be stacked up to 5 times
  max = 5,
})
----
====

If an image for immunity to that condition also exists, it can be provided as well.
Also, Condition immunities can be shared.
E.g. you can define that a figure is always immune to this new condition when it also has immunity to "Stun".
When a figure with a "Stun" immunity spawns, the immunity image for this new condition is applied as well.
This can be done by providing an `immunity` attribute.

====
[source,lua]
----
local ConditionApi = require("api.ConditionApi")

ConditionApi.registerCondition("My Condition", {
  image = "http://...",
  max = 5,
  immunity = {
    -- The image for the immunity
    image = "http://...",
    -- A list of other conditions or effects
    -- When the figure is immune to one of those, it will also be immune to "My Condition"
    sharedWith = { "Stun", "Pull" }
  }
})

== Effects

Effects are any special effects that a figure has.
They can be registered so that an image (or text) can be shown below the figure's HP bar.
When an Effect's name is then added to its xref:enemy.adoc#_stats[Stats], it will show the registered image (or text).
Effects can also be used to add additional images for movement types, or area of effects.

Registering an Effect is similar to a condition.
In fact, every Condition is also an Effect (so you don't have to register it twice).
The registration is done via the `registerEffect` function in the `ConditionApi`.
The attributes are similar to registering a Condition.
A difference is that the `name` is part of the table and not the first parameter to the function call.
Also, Effects currently don't use the `max` attribute.
Either an `image` or a `text` has to be supplied.
If the `image` is supplied, it will be shown when the Effect is active.
Otherwise, the `text` will be used (e.g. "AgD" is used for the Effect "Attacker gain Disadvantage").
Immunities work the same as for Conditions.

====
[source,lua]
----
local ConditionApi = require("api.ConditionApi")

ConditionApi.registerEffect({
  -- The name is part of the table, instead of an extra function parameter
  name = "My Effect",
  -- Either an image or a text has to be provided
  image = "http://...",
  text = "MyEff",
  -- Works the same as for conditions
  immunity = {
    image = "http://...",
    sharedWith = { "Stun", "Pull" }
  }
})
