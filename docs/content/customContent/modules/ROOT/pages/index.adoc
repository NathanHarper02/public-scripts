= Custom Content Integration

This documentation describes how custom content can be integrated into the Frosthaven Enhanced mod.

A lot has changed since the 1.3 version of the mod on how custom content could and should be created.
Therefore, this documentation is still a work in progress.

The main concept to add any custom content to the mod is using an xref:contentbox.adoc[content box].
