= Cleanup action

This xref:feature/gameKeys.adoc[Game Key] is a catch-all for returning things to their home. The table below outlines the uses for the Cleanup Action.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Object | Action

| Coins, Treasure Chests and objects with the `Loot` tag
| The object will move to the player mat of the player who used that action.

| Ability Card 
| Moved to lost pile

| Characters
| The character will exhaust by setting its HP to zero and moving the figure to the player mat of the player who used that action.

| Monsters, Summons and overlays with a health bar
| The object will be removed.
If it was a monster, it would also drop a coin. If it is a summoned monster, the mod checks the xref:interface/options.adoc#summons_drop_loot[current rules] setting to determine whether to drop a coin or not.
This is the same behaviour as reducing the objects' health to 0 and then pressing the btn:[Defeat] button in the center of its health bar.
This action will be performed if the objects' health is above 0.

| Battle Goals
| The battle goal will be returned to the battle goals deck.

| Traps and objects with the `Removable` tag
| The object will be deleted and a message will be printed in the chat.
