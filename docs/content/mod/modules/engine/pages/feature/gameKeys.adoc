= Game Keys

Game Keys are a concept of TTS, where players can assign a key on their keyboard to perform a specific action in the game.
The list of available Game Keys can be found while accessing the menu:Options[Game Keys] menu.
This section gives an overview of the available game actions that can be bound to a key.

Each player has to assign the Game Key themselves if they want to use it.
There's no way to share assigned Game Keys or assign default keys in the mod.
Assigned keys will stay between mod versions.
When migrating from 2.0.0 to v2.1.0 or beyond, the xref:feature/quickMenu.adoc[Quick Menu] and the xref:feature/cleanupAction.adoc[Cleanup Action] has been renamed and must be re-mapped by all users.

NOTE: Assigning a Game Key does not prevent the TTS default behavior for that key. E.g. if you assign the key "F" to a Game Key and use it while hovering over an object, it will still flip the object in addition to performing the game action.

However, as stated above, this means those keys have to reassigned for each player, if they want to use them again.

== The 2 Most Useful Game Keys: Quick Menu and Cleanup Action
The two most useful Game Keys are the xref:feature/quickMenu.adoc[Quick Menu] and the xref:feature/cleanupAction.adoc[Cleanup Action].

== Enhance Ability
While hovering over a character ability card, this will open the xref:campaign:enhancements.adoc[Enhancement Calculator].

[#_play_1st2nd_card]
== Play 1st/2nd/3rd Ability Card
While hovering over a card in a player's hand, these keys will place this card in the 1st/2nd/3rd ability card slot on the Play Area.
If there's already a card present, it will be moved to the player's hand again. This also works regardless of player color.
E.g. if you are the Black player and use this Game Key while hovering over a hand zone card for the Blue player, it will move the cards to the slot for the Blue player.
In addition to the Game Key you set here, the numbers at the top of the keyboard 1, 2, and 3 will set cards in their respective card slots on the Play Area.

== Discard Ability/Make Ability Active

While hovering over an ability card, this Game Key will move the card to the discard pile or the next free spot in the active area.
Those Game Keys are mainly meant when using Picture in Picture mode on the player mat.
Buttons don't work inside the PiP window, but Game Keys do.

== Sort Hand
This key will sort your hand in numerical order. When playing solo, it will sort only the active hand when pressed.
Geminate's hand does not split the sort into its two forms at this time.

== Open Search

While hovering a deck or a bag, this Game Key will open the Search Window for this container.

== Undo Deletion
This key will undo the most recent deletion. Accidentally delete a battle goal instead of returning it to the deck? Hit this key.

== Toggle Terrain Outline
This key will toggle the terrain type highlighted. At this time, the function is not extended beyond use in Scenario 0.

== Add/Remove Health
While hovering over a figure or token with a health bar, this key will add/remove one health from it.

== Add/Remove XP
While hovering over a character, this key will add/remove one XP.

== Next Stance/Previous Stance
While hovering over a character figure that has a stance bar, this key will move the active stance to the left or right.

== Add/Remove Resource 1/2/3
While hovering over a character figure that has a resource bar, this key will add or remove a resource from the specific resource bar.

== Draw Monster Attack Modifier
This action will draw a new Attack Modifier card from the enemy deck.

== Switch To Next Character
This key switches the player color to the next available player color that has a character loaded.
This is intended for solo or multi-handed play.

[#switch_player]
== Switch To Player 1/2/3/4/5/Solo Player
These actions quickly switch to the player seat associated with this player number.
For the Solo player, it will switch to the Black player color.
The switch is only successful if there isn't already another player seated for this player color.

Unfortunately, there's no way to preserve the current camera position before switching.
So instead of defaulting to moving the camera far away like, the camera will focus on the character mat for this player instead.

The camera behavior is the same as the one mentioned in the "Switch To Player" section.

== Section Tools
Useful for behind-the-scenes scripting and tinkering, particularly with blocking out specific section reads.
