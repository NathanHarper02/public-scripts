[#invalid-sort-order]
=== Error `invalid order function for sorting` during campaign migration

This error can show up in versions prior to 2.3 when trying to migrate the campaign to a newer version.
It will prevent some parts of the campaign to be migrated.
The following steps can be done to work around this problem:

* Find your TTS save file on your hard drive (check https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/getting-started/technical-info/#save-game-data-location[the knowledge base] to find the location for your system).
* Open the file with a text editor (any editor that supports a find and replace function is enough).
* Search for the following text `a.index \<= b.index` and replace it with `a.index < b.index`.
The search should show up 3 matches.
* Search for the text `a.name \<= b.name` and replace it with `a.name < b.name`.
The search should show up 1 match.
* Save the TTS save file and load it again in TTS
* The migration will all information is now possible.
