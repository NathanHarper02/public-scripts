=== Styles

You can add modifiers to help with fine placement, relocation, manipulating the element and much more. Here is a list of styles each element can take:

|===
| Syntax | Description | Example | Result

| margin | Adds a buffer space on all sides of an element. The first value is for spacing on top, then right, bottom and the last one is for spacing to the left. a| 
[source]
----
- earth: ''
  margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px
----|

| margin[direction] | Adds a buffer space on the specified side of an element. [direction] can be either Top, Left, Right or Bottom a| 
[source]
----
- earth: ''
  marginTop: 5px
----|

| padding | Include a buffer space on all sides of an element. the first value is for spacing on top, then right, and bottom and the last one is for spacing to the left. a| 
[source]
----
- earth: ''
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
----|

| padding[direction] | Include a buffer space on the specified side of an element. [direction] can be either Top, Left, Right or Bottom a| 
[source]
----
- earth: ''
  paddingTop: 5px
----|
|===

An important difference between padding and margin is that padding extends the boundingbox of the element, while a margin moves the element by adding a space outside the element. Also, the margin can take negative values to make the element take less space than the boundingbox of the element.
