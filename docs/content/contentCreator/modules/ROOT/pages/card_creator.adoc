[[introduction]]
== Introduction

On this page you will find detailed explanations of all commands and syntax options available in the Card Creator. Whether you're defining basic abilities or tweaking style and position, this guide will help you create clear and dynamic cards for your custom classes.

*Note:* The Card Creator currently has a few issues with rendering certain elements in browsers other than Chrome. If you encounter any problems, please try using Chrome for the best experience.

[[properties]]
== Properties

Before you begin creating your cards, it's recommended to define some properties. These properties will be used to customise the look of your custom class. This isn't strictly required, but it can help you to reinforce the thematic identity of your class.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

The syntax of the Card Creator uses simple commands to render icons and values. Commands typically follow this structure:

`- command: [value]`

Modifiers can be added to fine-tune placement, styling, or functionality. Sections below break down each command group. For many examples on card structure, feel free to browse the "Example Syntax" class present in the tool.

[[tab-hierarchy]]
== Tab Hierarchy

The structure of a card is based on indentation. Every sub-block or modifier must be indented with exactly 2 spaces more than its parent. This tells the system which modifiers belong to which command. For the purposes of this guide, "parent" refers to the block that is one level higher in the hierarchy.

For example:
[source]
----
- attack: 3
  margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px
----
In this example, the "margin" modifier is indented 2 spaces relative to the "- attack: 3" command, indicating that it applies specifically to that action.

Here is a more complex example:
[source]
----
- group:
  - attack: 3
  - divider
    margin: 10px 0px
  - move: 2
  - divider
  - optional:
    - consume: [dark,light]
    - heal: 2
      sub:
        - range: 3
        - wild
    noLine: true
  flexDirection: column
----
In this example, we have utilized a "group" block to contain multiple actions. Each action is indented 2 spaces relative to the "group" command. This indicates that they all belong to that outer block. The hierarchy continues with the "divider" and "optional" blocks, each containing their own sub-blocks.

A more detailed explanation of each block type is provided in the following sections.

Remember: use 2 spaces per level of indentation to maintain the proper hierarchy.


[[basic-actions]]

[[modifiers]]

[[conditions]]
== Conditions

Conditions modify abilities and can be used with or without an associated value. The available conditions include:

- bane
- bless
- brittle
- chill
- curse
- disarm
- dodge
- empower
- enfeeble
- immobilize
- impair
- infect
- invisible
- muddle
- pierce
- poison
- pull
- push
- regenerate
- rupture
- safeguard
- strengthen
- stun
- swing
- ward
- wound

[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Syntax | Description | Example | Result

| `- [condition]`
| Renders a condition icon.
| `- poison`
| image:icons/poison.svg[width=20px]

| `- [condition]: [value]`
| Renders a condition icon with an optional value.
| `- pierce: 1`
| image:icons/pierce.svg[width=20px] 1
|===

[[elements]]
== Elements

Elements represent various thematic or mechanical attributes. They support single values, consumption markers, and infuse modifiers.

Available elements include:

- earth
- fire
- air (or wind)
- ice
- light
- dark
- wild

Using multiple elements separated by '/' will generate an “or” condition.

[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Syntax | Description | Example | Result

| `- [element]`
| Renders the icon for the given element.
| `- earth`
| image:icons/earth.svg[width=20px]

| `- consume: [ [elements...] ]`
| Renders a list of element icons with an added consume marker (usually used within an optional block).
| `- consume: [earth, fire]`
| image:icons/earth.svg[width=20px] image:icons/consume.svg[width=10px] image:icons/fire.svg[width=20px] image:icons/consume.svg[width=10px]

| `infuse: [ [elements...] ]`
| Adds a mandatory box with a list of specified elements. (Note: As a modifier, do not prefix with a '-')
| `infuse: [earth, wild]`
| [!image:icons/earth.svg[width=20px] image:icons/wild.svg[width=20px]]
|===

*Note:* For infusion, this will only work at the first indentation level. This means that either `bottom:` or `top:` should be it's direct parent.

[[custom-actions]]
== Custom Actions

There exists a special block for custom actions, which allows you to write any text you want. This block is useful for creating unique abilities or actions that don't fit into the predefined categories.

Within these blocks, you are able to insert any of the common icons, such as conditions or elements, to further customize your text. This includes any class tokens that you've linked in the properties section.

The syntax for inserting these icons is: `%iconName%`.

Here are some examples of custom actions:

[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Syntax | Description | Example | Result

| `- custom: [text]`
| Creates a custom action with the specified text.
| `- custom: 'Text'`
| Text

| `- custom: [text]`
| Creates a custom action with the specified text.
| `- custom: 'Text with %poison% poison'`
| Text with image:icons/poison.svg[width=20px] poison

| `- custom: [text]`
| Creates a custom action with the specified text.
| `- custom: 'Text with %earth% earth and %fire% fire'`
| Text with image:icons/earth.svg[width=20px] earth and image:icons/fire.svg[width=20px] fire

| `- custom: [text]`
| Creates a custom action with the specified text.
| `- custom: 'Text with %classToken0% a custom class token'`
| Text with image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NathanHarper02/hearthkeeper/refs/heads/main/hearth_token.png[width=20px] a custom class token
|===

Any icon that has been inserted also has some special modifiers that can be applied to it. These modifiers are:

[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Modifier | Description | Example | Result

| 's'
| Removes the icon's shadow.
| `%classToken0s%`
| image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NathanHarper02/hearthkeeper/refs/heads/main/hearth_token.png[width=20px]

| 'i'
| Inverts the icon's color.
| `%poisoni%`
| image:icons/poison.svg[width=20px]

|===

[[sub-blocks]]
== Sub Blocks

Sub Blocks are the blocks that house the extra properties of an action. These are things like range, target, and other modifiers that can be applied to an action. These blocks are always indented 2 spaces from their parent action, like so:

[source]
----
- attack: 3
  sub:
    target: 2
    range: 3
    pierce: 1
----

In this example, the "sub" block contains the "target", "range", and "pierce" modifiers. These are all indented 2 spaces from the "attack" command, indicating that they are all part of that action.

The available attributes you can put in a sub block are:

[[optional-blocks]]
== Optional Blocks

Optional blocks represent abilities, or augments to abilities that come with a cost. The most frequent example of an optional block is an elemental consumption.

[[mandatory-blocks]]
== Mandatory Blocks

[[named-abilities]]
== Named Abilities

[[styles]]
== Styles & Modifiers

Modifiers allow you to fine-tune the placement, size, and appearance of each block. To apply modifiers, ensure each block is defined as an object (i.e. using a colon after the block name).

Below are some common style options:

[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Modifier | Description | Example | Result

| `margin`

[[special-blocks]]
== Special Blocks

Special blocks handle more complex card elements. They are designed to encapsulate functionality beyond basic actions.

[[tokens]]
=== Tokens

The tokens block creates token slots. Each number in the provided array represents the XP that the token slot provides.

[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Syntax | Description | Example | Result

| `- tokens: [0,1,0,1]`
| Creates token slots with XP values as defined in the array.
| `- tokens: [0,1,0,1]`
| Renders token slots accordingly.
|===

[[token-modifiers]]
==== Token Modifiers

Modifiers for tokens allow you to control how token slots are arranged.

[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Modifier | Description | Example | Result

| `lines`
| Forces tokens to render in a specific layout: either 3 or 4 tokens on 1 or 2 lines. Other numbers follow predefined arrangements (1–2 tokens on one line, 5–6 tokens on two lines).
|
[source]
----
- tokens: [0,1,0,1]
  lines: 1
----
| Arranged as specified.
