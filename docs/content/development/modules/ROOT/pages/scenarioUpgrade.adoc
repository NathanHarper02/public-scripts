= Upgrading Scenarios

This describes the process of upgrading scenarios from the old scenario format to the new scenario format.
The following terms are used to describe specific directories inside the repository:

Code directory:: The directory `packages/code`.
Mod directory:: The directory `mods/game/Frosthaven`.

== Convert the old scenario definition

Execute the command `pnpm scenario <index>` (e.g. `pnpm scenario 4`) inside the `packages/script` directory of the repository.
This will read the file `FH_<index>.lua` (e.g. `FH_004.lua`) and convert it to the new scenario format.
It will create a file `fh-<index>.ts` (e.g. `fh-4.ts`) inside the `src/game/frosthaven/scenario` directory of the code directory.
This file needs to be updated to change the scenario.

[#convert]
== Convert the scenario definition to a `.lua` file

The generated scenario definition is a TypeScript file.
To make it usable inside TTS, it needs to be a Lua file.
Run the command `pnpm build` inside the code directory to convert all TypeScript files to Lua files.
Alternatively, you could execute the command `pnpm dev` inside the same directory and keep the command line open where this command was executed.
This will start a watching process on all TypeScript files.
Whenever a TypeScript file is saved, it's automatically converted to the Lua file as long as this process is running.
Otherwise, the `pnpm build` command needs to be executed each time.

== Add the scenario to the Frosthaven game box

The above steps only create the scenario script itself, but not the token that holds that scenario.
Open the file `campaign.yaml` inside the `data` directory of the mod directory.
Add the index of the new scenario to the existing list.

.Example content of the `campaign.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
kind: campaign
name: Frosthaven
scenarios:
  - "1"
  - "2"
  - "3"
  - "4"
  # New scenarios are added here, and should be sorted
----

IMPORTANT: Be sure to surround the numbers with `"`.

Then execute the `pnpm embed` command from the mod directory (or the `pnpm embed:fh` command from the root directory which also includes this command).
This will generate the token that holds the scenario script and add it to the game box.

== Remove the old scenario

Inside the mod directory, find the directory  `content/Frosthaven.frosthaven/AutoAssets.assets/Scenarios.scenarios`.
Open the `Contents.json` file inside this directory and remove the entry for the removed scenario.
It can be identified by checking the scenario index.

.Before
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "path": "./FH-000.9911c9"
  },
  {
    "path": "./FH-004.831416"
  },
  {
    "path": "./FH-005.5f8908"
  }
]
----

.After
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "path": "./FH-000.9911c9"
  },
  {
    "path": "./FH-005.5f8908"
  }
]
----

Also, delete the directory of the same name inside that directory.
Embedding again will remove the old scenario from the game box.

== Testing and changing the scenario

First, load FHE as usual and start a new campaign.
Then, spawn the new scenario.
This is easiest by entering `>spawn-scenario fh-<index>` (e.g. `>spawn-scenario fh-4`) into the chat window.
Now save the game and load it again.

If everything already works as intended and is correctly placed, that's great.
If not, make adjustments to the scenario definition.
In order to not do the whole embedding and loading process all the time, it's easier to use VS Code with the TTS Editor extension (as mentioned xref:setup.adoc#vs-code[here]).

First, make sure the `pnpm dev` command is running somewhere (as mentioned <<convert, above>>).
This makes sure that any changes to the scenario definition are directly converted to Lua.
Then use the VS Code command palette (kbd:[CTRL+SHIFT+P] by default).
Search for the command "Update Object"

image::scenario/command-palette.png[]

Selecting this command will open another popup where you can select an object currently on the table of the loaded TTS save.
Search for the scenario token (which always has the name `fh-<index>`).

image::scenario/update-object.png[]

Select that again and now the object will be updated in the background with the current script.
Now simply spawn the scenario again to get the latest scenario definition.
Again, use the chat window to make this faster as this also includes clearing the current map.
Use the kbd:[Arrow Up] key to easily get to the last entered chat message again instead of typing it again.
